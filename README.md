# hello_world_keyboard
My own mechanical, fully programmable, less than 30$ keyboard project (which works)

## Why?
* Due to a durability of mechanical switches a self-made keyboard could be your last one
* Highly customizable
* Add special functions (like native mouse mode)
* IT'S FUN

## Features
* Additional down layer
* Mouse mode
* Easy mapping
* Potentiometer as joystick axis/sensitivity dial
* Encoder as arrows
